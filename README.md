# DRGLibModTemplate
Much like the regular mod template, but includes DRGLib pre-configured

## Using this template
1. Clone the repository/create your own repo using this as a template(And clone)
2. Run Automation/RebuildProject.bat (This .bat will download the current version of DRGLib, then link it into the FSD uproject

You've successfully setup your project to use DRGLib! If you need to update your project to a newer version of DRGLib, just run Automation/UpdateModules.bat . I'll do my best to keep DRGLib backwards compatible, but I am mearly a mortal dwarf. Updating should usually only be needed if you want to access a new feature of DRGLib
